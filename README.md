These three are the basic Data Science projects.
1.Fake News Detection which is used to predct from dtaset which news is fake or which is real.
2.Forest Fire Prediction which is used to predict in which area and upto which distance forests got fire.
3.Credit Card Fraud Prediction is used to predict the fraudulant activities done in credict card. 
     Actually this credit card project is done on google colab so you have run this file in your own system to see the output.

Other two "Fake news" and "Forest Fire" already have the output because it is made on the vs code, so you can look at that.
